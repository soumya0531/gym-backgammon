## <a name="gym_backgammon"></a>gym-backgammon
The backgammon game is a 2-player game that involves both the movement of the checkers and also the roll of the dice. The goal of each player is to move all of his checkers off the board.  

This repository contains a Backgammon game implementation in OpenAI Gym.   
Given the current state of the board, a roll of the dice, and the current player, it computes all the legal actions/moves (iteratively) that the current player can execute.  The legal actions are generated in a such a way that they uses the highest number of dice (if possible) for that state and player.

## <a name="installation"></a>Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/dellalibera/gym-backgammon.git
cd gym-backgammon/
pip3 install -e .
```

## <a name="env"></a>Environment
The encoding used to represent the state is inspired by the one used by Gerald Tesauro[1].

### <a name="actions"></a>Actions
The valid actions that an agent can execute depend on the current state and the roll of the dice. So, there is no fixed shape for the action space.  

### <a name="reward"></a>Reward
+1 if player WHITE wins, and 0 if player BLACK wins

### <a name="starting_state"></a>Starting State
All the episodes/games start in the same [starting position](#starting_position):

### <a name="episode_termination"></a>Episode Termination
1. One of the 2 players win the game
2. Episode length is greater than 10000


### <a name="reset"></a>Reset
The method `reset()` returns:
- the player that will move first (`0` for the `WHITE` player, `1` for the `BLACK` player) 
- the first roll of the dice, a tuple with the dice rolled, i.e `(1,3)` for the `BLACK` player or `(-1, -3)` for the `WHITE` player
- observation features from the starting position


### <a name="rendering"></a>Rendering
If `render(mode = 'rgb_array')` or `render(mode = 'state_pixels')` are selected, this is the output obtained (on multiple steps):

### <a name="example"></a>Example
#### <a name="play"></a>Play Random Agents
To run a simple example (both agents - `WHITE` and `BLACK` select an action randomly):
```
cd examples/
python3 play_random_agent.py
```
#### <a name="valid_actions"></a>Valid actions
An internal variable, `current player` is used to keep track of the player in turn (it represents the color of the player).   
To get all the valid actions:
```python
actions = env.get_valid_actions(roll)
```

The legal actions are represented as a set of tuples.    
Each action is a tuple of tuples, in the form `((source, target), (source, target))`     
Each tuple represents a move in the form `(source, target)` 

#### NOTE:
The actions of asking a double and accept/reject a double are not available.  

Given the following configuration ([starting position](#starting_position), `BLACK` player in turn, `roll = (1, 3)`):
```

```
The legal actions are:

## <a name="versions"></a>Backgammon Versions 
### `backgammon-v0`
The above description refers to `backgammon-v0`.

### `backgammon-pixel-v0`
The state is represented by `(96, 96, 3)` feature vector.    
It is the only difference w.r.t `backgammon-v0`.
